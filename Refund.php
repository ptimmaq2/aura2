<strong><font size="5">{HotelName} Hotel Refund Policy &#187;</strong></font>
<hr>
As {HotelName} Hotel offers an option to purchase, we offer <u>no refunds</u> meaning all payments are final. The reason being is because we don't want people purchasing
VIP and then getting banned or mad at us and then wanting a refund. In order for you to make a donation for VIP, you will need a verified PayPal account or else you
can't donate. The VIP feature is 100% instant wihich means you will receive your items if you have a successful payment and then you load into the Hotel. To see the
VIP benefits, visit the VIP page by clicking "Shop" in our main site. Donating for VIP is not a required thing and you will not be treated differently if you
don't wish to donate.
<br/><br/>
