DMCA: Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice and Policy ("Infringements Policy")


Babux Inc, Inc. ("Babux Inc", "we", or "us") respects others' intellectual property rights and has made every effort to secure appropriate clearances for all proprietary intellectual properties that Babux Inc directly makes available on its web site Babux.com (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise) and other interactive features or downloads (e.g., widgets) that are accessible on or downloadable through, or related to, http://25.88.140.109/ and owned or operated by Babux Inc (the "Site") and we require our users to do the same. Babux Inc will respond to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notification to an online service provider concerning alleged copyright infringement. When a valid DMCA notification is received, the service provider responds under this process by taking down the offending content. Upon taking down content under the DMCA, Babux Inc will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content to provide an opportunity for a counter-notification to be filed. On receiving a valid counter-notification, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity. You may use the notification process below to alert us to claims of infringement other than copyright but such notifications are not covered by the DMCA and will be governed by our Terms of Use.

Please note that these notifications and counter-notifications are real-world legal notices provided outside of the Site environment. Babux Inc may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or third parties, at our discretion and as required by law - the Privacy Policy for Babux Inc does not protect information provided in these notices.
